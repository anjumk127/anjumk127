# Anjum-Intro

Hi, I'm Anjum, a rising senior in high school. I'm part of the KKCF Fellowship, where I'm exploring my interests in data science and public policy. Through this fellowship, I hope to learn how data can influence public policies and work on projects that address real-world issues. I'm passionate about technology and coding, and I enjoy seeing how these fields connect with social justice and community advocacy. I'm looking forward to growing and learning more in these areas.
